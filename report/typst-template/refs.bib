	abstract = {With the advent of high-throughput technologies measuring high-dimensional biological data, there is a pressing need for visualization tools that reveal the structure and emergent patterns of data in an intuitive form. We present PHATE, a visualization method that captures both local and global nonlinear structure in data by an information-geometric distance between datapoints. We perform extensive comparison between PHATE and other tools on a variety of artificial and biological datasets, and find that it consistently preserves a range of patterns in data including continual progressions, branches, and clusters. We define a manifold preservation metric DEMaP to show that PHATE produces quantitatively better denoised embeddings than existing visualization methods. We show that PHATE is able to gain unique insight from a newly generated scRNA-seq dataset of human germ layer differentiation. Here, PHATE reveals a dynamic picture of the main developmental branches in unparalleled detail, including the identification of three novel subpopulations. Finally, we show that PHATE is applicable to a wide variety of datatypes including mass cytometry, single-cell RNA-sequencing, Hi-C, and gut microbiome data, where it can generate interpretable insights into the underlying systems.},

abstract = {Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia (SZ) exhibit compromised functional connectivity within extensive brain networks. However, the precise development of this impairment during disease progression in the clinical high-risk (CHR) population and their relatives remains unclear. Our study leveraged data from 128 resting electroencephalography (EEG) channels acquired from 30 SZ patients, 21 CHR individuals, 17 unaffected healthy relatives (RSs; those at heightened SZ risk due to family history), and 31 healthy controls (HCs). These data were harnessed to establish functional connectivity patterns. By calculating the geometric distance between EEG sequences, we unveiled local and global nonlinear relationships within the entire brain. The process of dimensionality reduction led to low-dimensional representations, providing insights into high-dimensional EEG data. Our findings indicated that CHR participants exhibited aberrant functional connectivity across hemispheres, whereas RS individuals showcased anomalies primarily concentrated within hemispheres. In the realm of low-dimensional analysis, RS participants' third-dimensional occipital lobe values lay between those of the CHR individuals and HCs, significantly correlating with scale scores. This low-dimensional approach facilitated the visualization of brain states, potentially offering enhanced comprehension of brain structure, function, and early-stage functional impairment, such as occipital visual deficits, in RS individuals before cognitive decline onset.}
